i need a function that will go through all the game properties, listing them and identifying  their owner,

identify the game properties according to their owners ie gameplayers that own the properties

according to the properties owned by a gameplayer calculate how many set of complete monopoly properties he has

if (he has a full set ){
he should develop the properties by buy houses and develop the property
}

if (he needs one or two to compkete the set) {
he should check if there are properties in the game properties array that can complete his set
        if(players own the properties){
             he sends funds that are fair and collect the property
             "a player should not send 2 properties to a player except when broke
}
}
if the human own the property he needs he should create a trade directed to the human
if the property he needs does not exist he should retun

once the property set is complete build as much houses as he can

use handle transfer property for ai - ai transfer
